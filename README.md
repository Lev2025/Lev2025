 <summary><h3>üìñ Levar's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 
 I began my journey as a community college Computer Engineering student in 2014 on a transfer track for NC State University. During college, I took classes on Intro to Computers, Databases, and Programming & Logic. My favorite classes were Programming & Logic and Databases Concepts, learning how software & data are built and stored through course projects. This brought me much excitement; though barely passing, I dreamed of a career as a software engineer to help others win with technology. 
<br><br/> 
 Early in 2015, I had unforeseen life circumstances adding urgency for a fast-track career to support my younger self at 19 years old. I incontinently abandoned hope for a software engineer career and pivoted for a career in IT. From 2015-17, I received a full-time Technical Support Engineer role while taking IT fast-track courses in Networking and IT support administration part-time. This was financially difficult supporting myself while paying community college tuition fees. At a crossroads, I dropped out, ending my college education with a total of 77 cumulative credits, and focused on growing my IT career in an alternative way. 
<br><br/> 
 Some years later, I've been in the IT industry for roughly 10 years and role required continuous learning to implement multiple new products for existing and new B2B customers. Though I succeeded, I could no longer ignore the difficulty of learning due to lack of focus and initiative, so I sought professional help. This lead to a diagnosis of ADHD (primarily inattentive) to my surprise and received medicine for treatment, unlocking a whole new world of possibilities. This alone made me more productive at work in project implementations and after-hours, successfully learning programming skills previously requiring strenuous willpower.
<br><br/>
 Now, I am working towards the dream I had for years learning software development to empower all to achieve success through technology. I have put myself on a self-learning roadmap to grow programming skills necessary to achieve a role in backend development within 3 years. In the short term, I will continue my current career, growing aptitude in IT including soft skills in strong communication, leadership, problem-solving, organization, and time management for future challenging projects.
