 <summary><h3>👨🏽‍💻 Lev's Software Development Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my software development journey as a community college IT Engineer student in 2014. Between 2014-15, I took classes on Intro to Computers, Databases, and Programming & Logic. My Programming & Logic class caused me grief due to the requirement of focus and study barely passing with a C. From 2015-19, I tried other courses for network engineering and IT administration with the same result, barely pasing while trying to work full time in a Support Engineer role. In 2020, I tried one last time taking 'Web, Database, & Programming' and 'Network Administration foundation' courses, then finally gave up on school with 77 cumulative credits earned. 
<br><br/>
Fast forward to March 2025, I've been in the IT industry for roughly 10 years with 5 years of IT project experience. My role required further learning to implement multiple new products for existing & new B2B customers. Though I succeeded, I struggled internally enough with focus & initiative learning to finally seek professional help. I received a diagnosis of ADHD (primarily inattentive) to my surprise and received medicine for treatment, which unlocked a whole new world of focus & initiative where I can finally be more productive at work in project implementations and afterhours learning programming.   
<br><br/>
Now, I am jumping into unfamiliar territory fulfilling that dream I had of learning software development to help people win with technology. I put myself on a self-learning roadmap to grow programming skills necessary to achieve a role in backend development within 5 years. In short-term, I will continue my current career growing professional consultancy soft skills in strong communication, leadership, problem-solving, organization, and time management to work on new and challenging projects in the exciting future to come.
<br><br/>
Thank you for reading my story! 🙏🏽
