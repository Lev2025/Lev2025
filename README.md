 <summary><h3>📖 Levar's Software Development Journey</h3></summary>
   I began my software development journey as a community college Computer Engineering student in 2014 on transfer track for NC State University. During college, I took classes on Intro to Computers, Databases, and Programming & Logic. My favorite classes were Programming & Logic and Databases Concepts learning how software & data are built and stored through course projects. This brought me much excitement, though barely passing, I dreamed of a career as a software engineer. 
   <br><br/>
   Early 2015, I had unforeseen life circumstances adding urgency for a fast track career to support my younger self at 19 years old. I incontinently pivoted to the IT due to barely passing Computer Science courses I abandoned hope for a dream software engineer career. From 2015-17, I received a full time Technical Support Engineer role while taking IT fast-track courses in networking and IT Support administration part time. This was financial difficult supporting myself while paying community college tuiton fees. At a crossroad, I dropped out ending my college education with total of 77 cumulative credits and focused on growing IT career in an alternative way. 
   <br><br/>
   Fast forward to March 2025, I've been in the IT industry for roughly 10 years with 5 years of IT project experience as a Professional Services Consultant. My role required further learning to implement multiple new products for existing and new B2B customers. Though I succeeded, I struggled internally enough with focus and initiative learning to seek professional help with productivity. I received a diagnosis of ADHD (primarily inattentive) to my surprise and received medicine for treatment unlocking a whole new world of focus and initiative. This has launched me to be more productive at work in project implementations and after-hours successfully learning software programming skills. 
   <br><br/>
   Now, I am working towards the software engineer dream I had for years to learn software development to empower all to achieve success through technology. I put myself on a self-learning roadmap to grow programming skills necessary to achieve a role in backend development within 5 years. In the short term, I will continue my current career growing aptitude in IT and soft skills in strong communication, leadership, problem-solving, organization, and time management.
<br><br/>
